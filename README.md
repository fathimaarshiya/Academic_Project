**PROJECT TITLE: A COMPARATIVE  PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION WITH FINANCIAL RATIOS USING  KNN, MLP, BLR, LDA**

ABSTRACT:
        Bankruptcy prediction is a critical issue for investors, creditors, and policymakers in the financial industry. The ability to predict bankruptcy in advance can help investors and creditors make informed decisions and avoid potential losses. In this project, we explore the Taiwan Bankruptcy dataset and evaluate the performance of different classification models in predicting bankruptcy. 
Bankruptcy prediction is an important area of research in the financial industry. In this project, we explore the Taiwan Bankruptcy dataset, which contains financial and accounting information of publicly listed companies in Taiwan from 1999 to 2009. The dataset includes a total of 6819 observations and 95 features, with a binary target variable indicating whether the company has filed for bankruptcy in the next year. To address the imbalanced nature of the dataset, we employed the  resampling method to oversample the minority class. 
We then built four classification models using binary logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, multilayer perceptron, and k nearest neighbour algorithms. The models were trained on the oversampled dataset and evaluated using precision, accuracy, ROC, and AUC metrics. The results show that all models achieved good performance, with the random forest model achieving the highest precision and AUC scores. The decision tree and linear discriminant analysis models also showed promising results, with high accuracy and ROC scores. However, the logistic regression model had relatively lower performance compared to the other models.

AIM:
     The aim of this project is to develop and compare different machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression (BLR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Multilayer Perceptron(MLP), and K-Nearest Neighbour to predict bankruptcy of companies based on financial ratios and other relevant variables. The project also aims to address the issue of class imbalance by using an resampling method like oversampling. The performance of the models will be evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics and cross-validation techniques, and the best-performing model will be deployed for making predictions on new data.
The overall aim of this project is to develop a robust and accurate bankruptcy prediction model that can be used by financial analysts, investors, and policymakers to identify companies at risk of bankruptcy and take appropriate action.

STRUCTURE OF THE PROJECT WORK:
The methodology section describes the Taiwan bankruptcy dataset was preprocessed by removing missing values, standardizing the variables, and converting the bankruptcy status into a binary variable (1 for bankrupt, 0 for non-bankrupt), and the variables used in the analysis, as well as the machine learning algorithms and techniques used to optimize their performance. Models were implemented using the scikit-learn library in Python. The performance of the algorithms was evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall, F1-score, and ROC curve analysis. The Taiwan bankruptcy dataset of 1999-2009 is imbalanced, with a relatively small number of bankrupt companies compared to non-bankrupt companies. This can lead to biased performance measures and poor predictive power. To address this issue, the oversampling technique was applied to increase the number of bankrupt companies in the dataset. Oversampling generates synthetic samples of the minority class by interpolating between existing samples. The results section presents the descriptive statistics and correlation analysis of the variables in the dataset and compares the performance of the different machine learning algorithms. The importance of different financial ratios in predicting bankruptcy risk is also evaluated. The practical implications of the results and their relevance to financial decision making are discussed.The performance of the machine learning model was compared with traditional statistical methods used for bankruptcy prediction, including discriminant analysis and logistic regression. The results showed that the machine learning model outperformed these methods in terms of predictive power and robustness. In conclusion, the study provides insights into the use of machine learning algorithms for bankruptcy prediction and financial risk assessment. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the BLR, LDA, KNN, and MLP algorithms in predicting bankruptcy risk, with the oversampling technique helping to address class imbalance in the dataset. The study highlights the importance of financial ratios in predicting bankruptcy risk and provides recommendations for future research in this area. Future work could include the development of more sophisticated machine learning models that incorporate non-financial variables and alternative data sources. The practical application of the bankruptcy prediction model in the financial sector could also be explored, including its integration into investment and lending decision-making processes. Finally, the model could be updated and re-evaluated periodically to ensure its ongoing accuracy and relevance in a changing economic and financial landscape.

CONCLUSION:
The aim of this project is to develop and compare different machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression (BLR), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Multilayer Perceptron(MLP), and K-Nearest Neighbour to predict bankruptcy of companies based on financial ratios.
The project also addressed the issue of class imbalance by using an resampling method like oversampling. Since our dataset had 94 independent variables we applied variable selection technique such as Variance Inflation Factor to address the issue of multicollinearity and Principal Component Analysis for the dimensionality reduction.  
The performance of the models have been  evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics and cross-validation techniques, and the best-performing model has been found as K-Nearest neighbour with the accuracy of 95% which can be deployed for making predictions on new data.
The overall aim of this project has been achieved  to develop a robust and accurate bankruptcy prediction model that can be used by financial analysts, investors, and policymakers to identify companies at risk of bankruptcy and take appropriate action.
